The first line of such a file indicates the names of the features, the following lines each contain a single instance.\n",

    "Use the cell below to load the data from the CSV file. The data should be loaded into a _data frame_. Data frames are available in python using the ```pandas``` library. In comparison to matrices or similar types, they allow different types of columns, are usually easier to manipulate, e.g., by adding or removing rows/columns, and rows and columns can be named. \n",

This is an ID feature for the instances in the data. Such data must often be removed before further analysis of the data. Your second task is to remove this feature from the data."

All missing values are marked as NA in the CSV file. \n",
